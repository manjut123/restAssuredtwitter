Regression 
findByaccountlocalstore

Compare response  for service in legency server (qa01) and (qa02) production server with different value for below parameter
    - request type - by statment,date range,
Compare response fields value with related DB table data

Functional checks - findaccountBylocalstore

Response Fields and value should be identical in soap and rest reponse.

REST request param mvd as false

RequestType param enum checks -
- Test that response in SOAP and REST service is same request type - by statment, 
- Test that response in SOAP and REST service is same request type - by date range
- Test that    

Maxrec param
  - Test that SOAP and REST response contain records as per maxparam define

Timeout 
   - Test with different timeout parameter 
         timeout as 500 for 100 records , timeout as 2000 more than 100 records.

Check related with DB Data conditioning 
 
    Test with accountID status as sold/stolen,frozen,traded
    Test with accountID belongs to different partner along with multiple cpc
    Test with accountID transaction record contain different transType
    
Negative Functional Checks

  Test by passing invalid accountID,requesttype
  Test by passing empty accountID and null as accountID
  Test by passing empty request status and null as request status
  Test with maxrecords in minus number

Authorization
  - Verify result if invalid clientid 
  - Check failure if invalid password given
  - Checks failure if header(header name) value is wrong / empty /null
   - Checks failure if header(header name) value is wrong /empty/null
